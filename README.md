# La Caja - Game Project Repository

## 🚦 Project Guidelines

This repository is the **official, stable version** of the project. It is maintained by the coordinator (Juan).

### 🧠 If you are part of the team (design, audio, art, writing):

- You are **not required to use GitHub**.
- You can work on assets locally and send them to Juan for integration.

### 🧳 How to Send Your Work

Please send assets in one of these ways:

#### 🎯 Option A - Preferred
Export as `.unitypackage`:
1. In Unity, right-click your files or folders (like Prefabs, Models, etc.)
2. Select `Export Package...` (✅ include dependencies)
3. Name it clearly (e.g., `environment-props-v2.unitypackage`)
4. Send via Google Drive (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ulJZbWsvYNMcb7rE0yE-O7Vr9DFeMjEU?usp=drive_link)

### 💡 Notes for Team Members

- Don't modify `Assets/Scenes/MainScene.unity` directly unless told.
- Add your initials or name to files you create (e.g., `Radio_Gabriela.prefab`)
- Only Juan will commit updates to this repository to avoid conflicts.
- If you want to experiment, you can create your own Unity project.

### 🔐 Git Rules (for developers)

- Only Juan pushes to `main` and manages branches.
- Git LFS is enabled for large files (.fbx, .png, .wav, etc.)
